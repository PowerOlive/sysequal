# sysequal

> Use your System Equalizer system wide

<img src=".assets/cover.png" width="900">

Sysequal (as in **Sys**tem **Equal**izer) is a small utility
application which launches your System Equalizer. Most Android flavors
come with a decent Audio Equalizer shipped, but it is only accessible on an
application basis. Sysequal launches your Equalizer and restores
settings after reboot.
